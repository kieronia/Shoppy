# Shoppy

Basic username checker.
I made this originally to find sellers on the app shoppy, but realised that lots of usernames that could be considered "rare" where discovered, so decided to save them to a file in case a user of this program is tryna get a catchy username.
With apis it's able to find random store names and validate them, pretty fast too as there's no ratelimits ;)
This most likely classes as api abuse,against their tos, hence this is a demonstration, usage of it is your responsibilty ;)
